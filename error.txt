/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:1331: UserWarning: dropout2d: Received a 2-D input to dropout2d, which is deprecated and will result in an error in a future release. To retain the behavior and silence this warning, please use dropout instead. Note that dropout2d exists to provide channel-wise dropout on inputs with 2 spatial dimensions, a channel dimension, and an optional batch dimension (i.e. 3D or 4D inputs).
  warnings.warn(warn_msg)
/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/torch/nn/_reduction.py:42: UserWarning: size_average and reduce args will be deprecated, please use reduction='sum' instead.
